## Question
How do you mentor junior developers?

## Answer

Mentoring junior developers is about fostering growth, building confidence, and creating a supportive learning environment. Effective mentoring combines technical guidance with soft skills development.

## Mentoring Philosophy

### Growth Mindset Approach
```javascript
const mentoringPhilosophy = {
  belief: 'Skills can be developed through dedication and hard work',
  approach: 'Emphasize learning from mistakes over avoiding them',
  goal: 'Help juniors become independent, confident developers',
  measure: 'Track progress and celebrate improvements'
};
```

### Individualized Learning
```javascript
const individualizedApproach = {
  assessment: 'Understand their current skill level and learning style',
  customization: 'Adapt teaching methods to their preferences',
  pacing: 'Match the speed of instruction to their comprehension',
  goals: 'Set personal development objectives together'
};
```

## Structured Mentoring Program

### Onboarding Process
```javascript
const onboardingFramework = {
  week1: {
    focus: 'Environment Setup & Basic Tools',
    activities: [
      'Development environment configuration',
      'Version control (Git) basics',
      'Project structure overview',
      'Basic coding standards'
    ],
    deliverables: 'Working development environment, first commit'
  },
  week2: {
    focus: 'Core Technologies & Concepts',
    activities: [
      'Language/framework fundamentals',
      'Basic project contribution',
      'Code review participation',
      'Testing introduction'
    ],
    deliverables: 'First pull request, basic understanding'
  },
  month1: {
    focus: 'Independent Contribution',
    activities: [
      'Feature development',
      'Bug fixing',
      'Documentation',
      'Team processes'
    ],
    deliverables: 'Independent task completion, team integration'
  }
};
```

### Regular Check-ins
```javascript
const checkInStructure = {
  frequency: 'Weekly 30-minute sessions',
  format: {
    progress: 'What have they learned/accomplished?',
    challenges: 'What obstacles are they facing?',
    goals: 'What are their next objectives?',
    feedback: 'How can I better support them?'
  },
  documentation: 'Keep notes on progress and action items'
};
```

## Teaching Techniques

### Code Review as Teaching
```javascript
const codeReviewMentoring = {
  approach: 'Use PR reviews as learning opportunities',
  techniques: {
    explain: 'Why certain changes are requested',
    suggest: 'Alternatives with reasoning',
    reference: 'Documentation or best practices',
    encourage: 'Ask questions to guide thinking'
  },
  example: {
    bad: 'Use early return here',
    good: 'Consider using early return to reduce nesting. This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow. What do you think?'
  }
};
```

### Pair Programming Sessions
```javascript
const pairProgramming = {
  driverNavigator: {
    driver: 'Writes the code',
    navigator: 'Thinks strategically, asks questions',
    rotation: 'Switch roles every 15-25 minutes'
  },
  techniques: {
    explain: 'Verbalize your thought process',
    question: 'Ask about their approach and reasoning',
    suggest: 'Offer alternatives without taking over',
    celebrate: 'Praise good practices and insights'
  },
  benefits: 'Knowledge transfer, real-time feedback, relationship building'
};
```

### Project-Based Learning
```javascript
const projectBasedLearning = {
  miniProjects: {
    examples: [
      'Build a todo app',
      'Create a weather dashboard',
      'Implement a blog system'
    ],
    purpose: 'Apply concepts in practical scenarios'
  },
  incremental: {
    start: 'Simple version with basic features',
    iterate: 'Add complexity gradually',
    refactor: 'Improve code quality over time'
  },
  review: 'Discuss decisions and alternative approaches'
};
```

## Knowledge Transfer Methods

### Documentation and Guides
```javascript
const knowledgeBase = {
  teamWiki: {
    content: 'Project setup, coding standards, common patterns',
    maintenance: 'Keep updated with new learnings'
  },
  codeExamples: {
    repository: 'Annotated examples of common tasks',
    comments: 'Explain why and how, not just what'
  },
  troubleshooting: {
    guides: 'Common issues and solutions',
    debugging: 'Step-by-step problem-solving approaches'
  }
};
```

### Teaching Through Questions
```javascript
const socraticMethod = {
  technique: 'Guide with questions rather than direct answers',
  example: {
    junior: 'This function is not working',
    mentor: 'What error are you seeing? What have you tried? What does the function do?'
  },
  benefits: 'Develops problem-solving skills, builds confidence'
};
```

## Soft Skills Development
