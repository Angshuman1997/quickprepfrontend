# How do you mentor junior developers?

## Simple Answer
I mentor juniors by combining technical guidance with hands-on learning. I focus on building their confidence through small wins, teaching problem-solving skills, and creating a supportive environment where they can ask questions without fear.

## My Mentoring Approach

### 1. Start with Fundamentals
- Set up their development environment
- Teach Git basics and code standards
- Explain project structure and workflows

### 2. Hands-On Learning
- Pair programming sessions
- Code reviews as teaching moments
- Small feature assignments with guidance

### 3. Regular Check-ins
- Weekly 30-minute meetings
- Discuss progress, challenges, and goals
- Provide constructive feedback

## Key Techniques

### Code Reviews
Instead of just saying "fix this," I explain why:
- "This early return reduces nesting and improves readability"
- "Consider extracting this into a custom hook for reusability"

### Teaching Through Questions
Guide rather than give direct answers:
- "What error are you seeing?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What do you think might be causing this?"

### Project-Based Learning
- Start with simple projects (todo app, weather dashboard)
- Gradually increase complexity
- Review decisions and discuss alternatives

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Imposter Syndrome
- Share my own early career struggles
- Celebrate small wins and progress
- Remind them everyone starts somewhere

### Knowledge Gaps
- Identify specific areas needing work
- Provide targeted resources and examples
- Create practice opportunities

### Motivation Issues
- Connect work to their interests
- Vary task types to keep it engaging
- Recognize efforts, not just results

## Interview Q&A

**Q: How do you handle a junior who keeps making the same mistakes?**
A: I focus on understanding why they're making the mistake. Is it a knowledge gap or misunderstanding? I explain the concept clearly, show examples, and have them practice until they get it. Patience and repetition are key.

**Q: What's your approach to giving feedback?**
A: Make it timely, specific, and actionable. Balance positive feedback with areas for improvement. Always end with encouragement and next steps.

**Q: How do you scale mentoring for multiple juniors?**
A: Use group sessions for common topics, encourage peer mentoring, and create shared resources like code examples and troubleshooting guides.

**Q: How do you know if your mentoring is effective?**
A: Track their progress through completed projects, code quality improvements, and their growing independence. Regular feedback surveys help me adjust my approach.

## Key Principles
- **Individualized**: Adapt to their learning style and pace
- **Patient**: Allow time for concepts to sink in
- **Supportive**: Create a safe space for questions and mistakes
- **Practical**: Focus on real-world application over theory
- **Growth-focused**: Emphasize learning and improvement over perfection</content>
